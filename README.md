# Project for neural networks
See wiki for details.

Since I've forgotten to create file with predictions for test set and I've already overwritten my files where I've saved parameters I had to train the network again. It has reached slightly worse performance (14.04% test error rate insted of 13.98%) but I didn't change the report. IPython notebooks with both networks are in the repo.
